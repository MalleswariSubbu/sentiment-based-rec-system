    "\n",
    "#### Problem Statement: \n",
    "In E-commerce business, a company launches its website to sell the items to the end consumer, and customers can order the products that they require from the same website. Famous examples of such e-commerce companies are Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra, Paytm and Snapdeal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ebuss is one such company and has captured a huge market share in many fields, and it sells the products in various categories such as household essentials, books, personal care products, medicines, cosmetic items, beauty products, electrical appliances, kitchen and dining products and health care products.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for further growth in the market, we are asked to build a model that will improve the recommendations given to the users given their past reviews and ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do this, we planned to build a sentiment-based product recommendation system, which includes the following tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data sourcing and sentiment analysis\n",
    "2. Building a recommendation system\n",
    "3. Improving the recommendations using the sentiment analysis model\n",
    "4. Deploying the end-to-end project with a user interface"

    "\n",
    "In this task, we have to analyse product reviews after some text preprocessing steps and build an ML model to get the sentiments corresponding to the users' reviews and ratings for multiple products.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps to be performed for the first task are given below.\n",
    "\n",
    "a) Exploratory data analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Data cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "c) Text preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "d) Feature extraction: In order to extract features from the text data, we may choose from any of the methods, including bag-of-words, TF-IDF vectorization or word embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "e) Training a text classification model: we need to build at least three ML models. we then need to analyse the performance of each of these models and choose the best model. At least three out of the following four models need to be built (Do not forget, if required, handle the class imbalance and perform hyperparameter tuning.). \n",
    "    i) Logistic regression\n",
    "    ii) Random forest\n",
    "    iii) XGBoost\n",
    "    iv) Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "f) Out of these four models, we need to select one classification model based on its performance"
